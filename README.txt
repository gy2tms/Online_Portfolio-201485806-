--- README file for the 'Agent Based Model' ---

CONTENTS:
  License.txt = license documentation for the project 
  'model.py' = The base source code for the agent based model 
  'agentframework.py' = the agent framework for use within the agent based model code
  'in.txt' = The raster data used within the model 
  
WHAT THE SOFTWARE IS: 
  These python source code files program a basic framework of an 'agent based model'
  
HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
  To efficiently run this model, both the 'model.py', 'agentframework' and 'in.txt' files need to be
  downloaded and saved within a singular directory.
  
  The 'model.py' is then to be run first within a programming console to which it will extract data 
  and processing function from the remaining two files.

WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM THE CODE:
  This set of code has been produced to provide a framework for an agent based model. Once the code 
  is run, the model reads in the raster data follwed by producing and altering an adaptable quantity of 
  agents witihin a plotted grid. The agents processing attributes and actions can be altered
  to the users desired context and needs within the source code. Finally an animated output is produced
  showing the agents moving throughout the environment, with printed outputs detailing relevant information
  of both the raster data and the script.
  
FUTURE ALTERATIONS OR IDEAS:
  This code could be adapted with time to be used as a GUI to web scrape the internet for data without being
  intrusive within the source code itself, allowing for an easier and more efficient alteration of the set 
  code and the respective outputs
