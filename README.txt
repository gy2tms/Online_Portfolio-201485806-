--- README file for the 'Agent Based Model' ---

CONTENTS:
  License.txt = license documentation for the project 
  'model.py' = The base source code for the agent based model 
  'agentframework.py' = the agent framework for use within the agent based model code
  'in.txt' = The raster data used within the model 
  
WHAT THE SOFTWARE IS: 
  These python source code files program a basic frameowrk of a agent based model
  
HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
  To efficiently run this model both the 'model.py', 'agentframework' and 'in.txt' files need to be
  downloaded and saved within a singular directory.
  
  The 'model.py' is then to be run first within a programming console to which it will extract data 
  and processing function from the remaining two files.

WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM THE CODE:
  This set of code has been produced to provide a framework for an agent based model. Once the code 
  is run, the model reads in the raster data follwed by producing and altering a adaptable quantity of 
  agents witihin a plotted grid, the characteristics of the agents processing and actions can be altered
  to the users desire within the source code. Finally a animated output is producing showing the agents
  moving throughout the environment
  
FUTURE ALTERATIONS OR IDEAS:
  This code could be adapted with time to as a GUI to web scrape the internet for data without being
  intrusive in the source code itself, allowing for a more easily and more efficiently altering set 
  code and the respective outputs
